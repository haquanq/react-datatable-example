## React DataTable Example

My experiment with building features-rich DataTable component with React

## Featues

- [x] Sort columns (maximum 3 columns at once - sort by most recently sorted column)
- [x] Filter columns (multiple columns at once)

## Tools

- Zustand for global state management
- BaseUI for common components: dialog, popover,...
- LucideIcon for well-made icons
- TailwindCSS for fast prototyping
- FakerJS for fake data
